# ESP32-OpenWeather-High-Low

This project is origioally based on a previous project of mine, https://github.com/bdash9/ESP32-OpenWeatherMap, 
and code by Rui Santos at https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-http-get-open-weather-map-thingspeak-arduino/

The code present the temp (current/high/low), humidity and Sky condition. 
The blue dot is SUPPOSED to show where the current temp is relative to the high and low temps but it doesn't work.
Also after 10 minutes a larger diameter ring of rainbow triangles appear...still can't figure that out.
Please let me know if you do!
